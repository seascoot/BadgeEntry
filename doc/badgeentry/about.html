      <p>BadgeEntry is designed to be an attendance and access control system for children's activities. Because it is web-based, as many computers as is necessary can access a single install, provided the computers are properly networked. Also, BadgeEntry is pretty much operating system independent. In other words, it runs on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.</p>
      <h2 class="text" id="features">Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="../../images/web/sample_badge_scott.png" class="photo" style="float:right" /><b>BadgeEntry is a name tag system with a twist.</b> It produces name tags that contain a barcode and optional photo corresponding to the bearer. This barcode is scanned upon entry and exit. Scanning the barcode serves two main purposes: First, it provides an efficient way to manage attendance. Second, it's fun for the kids to scan their badges and see their name and picture flash on the screen.</li>
          <li><b>BadgeEntry is an attendance system.</b> It provides both an up-to-date snapshot of current attendance during the meeting and a record of attendance for all events, complete with the time everyone entered and exited.</li>
          <li><b>Additional features</b> include the ability to select a random "volunteer" from among the current attendees and the ability to assign attendees to several categories (kids, staff, parents, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="text" id="requirements">System Requirements</h2>
        <p>BadgeEntry is designed to run by multiple computers. You can run it on as few as two machines (one in a pinch), or as many as you need to handle a large group. Here's how it works (specific details are on the <a href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> page):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, you <a href="install.html">install</a> BadgeEntry on a computer that meets the <a href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a>. This computer is now the server.</li>
          <li>Next, you need to designate a computer to serve as kiosk. This is the computer that will scan the barcodes on the badges and display the bearer's name and (optional) photo. If you have a large group, you can set up as many kiosks as you need. In a small setup, the kiosk can easily be the same machine as the server.</li>
          <li>You also need a computer to print the badges and register people. This computer should not double as a kiosk. It needs a printer and a supply of unruled 3x5 inch index cards. If your group is large enough, you might want multiple computers for registration and/or printing.</li>
          <li>Finally, you need a router and a barcode scanner. See the <a href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> page for details.</li>
        </ol>
